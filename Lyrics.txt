Just a brown haired girl
Playing in a lonely world
She took a mine cart trip going anywhere 
Just a fearless boy
Learned to fight all the monsters 
He took a Minecraft trip going anywhere
A miner in a scary room
A sight of blood a zombies tomb
Kill a spider and then win the night
It goes on and on and on and on
Creepers pacing 
Up and down his perfect yard 
Their figures creeping
In the night 
Pale white skellys 
Shootin just for some amusement 
Fightin somewhere in the night 
Fighting hard to get that kill
Everybody wants a thrill
Doing anything to get a slice 
Just one more time 
Some will win
Some will lose 
Some will end without a bruise 
Oh the story never ends 
It goes on and on and on and on
Creepers pacing 
Up and down his perfect yard 
Their figures creeping in the night
Pale white skellys 
Shootin just for some amusement 
Fightin somewhere in the night 
Don’t stop the fighting
Hold on to that fellin 
Creepers pacing
Don’t stop the fighting 
Hold on
Creepers pacing
:)
